# 🧠 Midterm Project: NLP Analysis on FDD Documents

**Group Number**: [Enter Group Number]  
**Group Members**: [Alphabetically list names here]

## 📘 Project Overview

For our midterm project, we explored Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) data using NLP techniques. Each group was given a choice between two datasets:

- **FDD Item 5 Dataset** (relatively easier)
- **FDD Item 12 Dataset**

Our objective was to extract insights and perform question-answering tasks using Python-based NLP workflows.

## 📂 Deliverables

Each group is required to submit the following:
- 📝 A written report (minimum 5 pages)
- 📊 A presentation deck (approximately 15 slides)
- 💻 A Python/Jupyter Notebook file

> ⚠️ Only one group submission is needed. No individual submissions.

## 📊 Grading Breakdown

### 1. 🧾 Coding Component (60 Points)

- **Dataset Selection**: Choose one dataset (Item 5 or Item 12).
- **Word Cloud Visualizations** (10 points)
  - Use one file to generate 3 visualizations:
    - Bag of Words (BoW)
    - N-Gram
    - TF-IDF

- **Topic Modeling & Interpretation** (10 points)
  - Apply at least:
    - One frequency-based method
    - One embedding method

- **Question Answering Task** (40 points)
  - For **Item 5**: Extract initial fees from all 50 files.
  - For **Item 12**: Determine if exclusive territory is offered.

> 💡 Final grading based on question-answering accuracy.
